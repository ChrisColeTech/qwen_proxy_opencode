# The Qwen.ai Electron Problem & Solution

## The Problem

The qwen.ai website does not work properly in Electron BrowserWindows:
- Page loads initially
- When you click sign-in, the page goes blank
- No navigation or popup events are triggered
- DevTools disconnects (indicating some kind of page reload/clear)
- This happens even with minimal Electron configuration

## Why This Happens

The qwen.ai website likely uses browser APIs or techniques that conflict with Electron's rendering engine. Possible causes:
1. Client-side JavaScript that detects it's not running in a "real" browser
2. Use of browser features not fully supported in Electron
3. Anti-automation/bot detection

## Solutions

### Option 1: Manual Cookie Input (RECOMMENDED)
Let users log in via their regular browser, then manually copy/paste cookies into the app.

**Pros:**
- Always works
- No compatibility issues
- Users can use their preferred browser with saved passwords

**Cons:**
- Less convenient
- Requires user to understand how to extract cookies

### Option 2: Use Playwright/Puppeteer
Launch a real Chrome instance via Playwright to handle login, then extract cookies.

**Pros:**
- Full browser compatibility
- Can handle complex OAuth flows

**Cons:**
- Adds significant dependencies
- Slower
- More complex

### Option 3: Direct API Authentication
If Qwen has an API key or token-based auth, use that instead of cookies.

**Pros:**
- Clean, simple
- No browser needed

**Cons:**
- Requires Qwen to support this (may not be available)

## Recommended Approach

Implement **manual cookie input** as the primary method, with clear instructions for users on how to extract cookies from their browser.
