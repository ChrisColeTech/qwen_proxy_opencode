Host: localhost:3000
Accept: application/json

OpenCode calls this endpoint to discover available models.

Expected response: Standard OpenAI models list format
- object: "list"
- data: array of model objects

Each model should include:
- id: model identifier
- object: "model"
- created: timestamp
- owned_by: provider name
- metadata: optional additional info (capabilities, limits, etc.)

Our proxy already implements this endpoint correctly.
