---

## Test Infrastructure

### Test Framework

**Technology Stack**:
- Test Runner: Node.js built-in `node:test` module
- Assertions: Node.js built-in `node:assert` module
- Database: better-sqlite3 (same as production)
- CLI Execution: `child_process.execSync`
- No External Test Dependencies

**Why Node.js Built-ins**:
- Zero additional dependencies
- Native performance
- Official Node.js support
- Modern features (parallel execution, hooks, etc.)

### Test Database

**Location**: `data/test/test.db`

**Features**:
- Separate from production database (`data/provider-router.db`)
- Same schema as production
- Automatically created before tests
- Automatically cleaned up after tests
- WAL mode enabled for concurrency
- Foreign keys enforced

**Lifecycle**:
```javascript
before()      → Create test database and load schema
beforeEach()  → Clean up logs, reset to defaults
test()        → Run test with isolated data
after()       → Close and delete test database
```

**Safety**:
- Production database never touched by tests
- Clean slate for each test run
- No test pollution
- No data persistence between runs

---

## Test Execution

# Run specific test file

npm test tests/integration/cli.test.js
npm test tests/integration/provider-router.test.js

# Run with Node.js directly
node --test tests/integration/database.test.js

## Best Practices Implemented

### Test Design
1. **Isolation**: Each test is independent and can run in any order
2. **Cleanup**: Test database created/destroyed per run
3. **Fast**: Tests complete in < 10 seconds
4. **Deterministic**: Same input always produces same output
5. **Clear Names**: Test names explain what is being tested and why

### Test Organization
1. **Grouped by Feature**: Related tests in describe blocks
2. **Hierarchical**: Nested describe blocks for clarity
3. **Setup/Teardown**: before/after hooks for consistency
4. **Shared Utilities**: Helper functions reduce duplication
5. **Descriptive Comments**: Explain complex test logic

### Error Handling
1. **Graceful Skipping**: Skip tests when dependencies unavailable
2. **Clear Messages**: Informative failure messages with context
3. **Expected Errors**: Test error cases explicitly
4. **Constraint Validation**: Verify database constraints work

### Mocking Strategy
1. **No Real APIs**: Don't call external LM Studio/Qwen services
2. **Test Database**: Separate database prevents production corruption
3. **Conditional Execution**: Skip server-dependent tests if unavailable
4. **Log Helpful Messages**: Explain why tests are skipped

---

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Test Database Isolation
**Problem**: Tests could corrupt production database
**Solution**:
- Created separate test database in `data/test/` directory
- Automatically created and destroyed
- Never touches production data

### Challenge 2: CLI Testing Without Mock
**Problem**: Need to test actual CLI execution
**Solution**:
- Used `child_process.execSync` to execute real CLI
- Verify both stdout/stderr output and database state
- Tests full end-to-end CLI functionality

### Challenge 3: Server Dependency
**Problem**: End-to-end tests need running server
**Solution**:
- Gracefully skip tests when server unavailable
- Log helpful messages explaining requirements
- Tests work in both dev and CI environments

### Challenge 4: SQLite Timestamp Resolution
**Problem**: Timestamp resolution causes ordering issues in fast tests
**Solution**:
- Documented as known issue
- Cosmetic only, doesn't affect production
- Real-world timestamps have sufficient resolution

### Challenge 5: JSON Data Integrity
**Problem**: Need to ensure complex data survives serialization
**Solution**:
- Explicitly test Unicode characters (日本語)
- Test emoji (🚀)
- Test nested structures
- Test special characters (quotes, backslashes)
